## About 
* 👋 Hi, I’m Chidike Henry
* 😎 I’m a fullstack developer
* 💻 This is FINTECH WALLET API, which I built to allow users register, login and add funds to manage transactions. 
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on JS projects
* 📫 How to reach me chidike.henry@gmail.com


## Introduction
The project is testing my ability to design and implement a scalable, secure, and well-documented Fintech API that handles user authentication, 
fund management, and transaction processing. It evaluates my skills in API design, database optimization, and secure payment integrations 
while ensuring real-time updates and financial data accuracy. Additionally, it assesses my capability to enforce robust security measures, 
rate limiting, and transactional integrity, ensuring seamless and fraud-resistant API usage. This task aims to gauge my proficiency in backend development, 
third-party payment integrations, and real-world Fintech challenges.


## The Task
So, you are to create a digital wallet service with the following features:

* Implement user registration and secure login, supporting authentication methods like OAuth2.
* Allow users to add funds using mock payment gateways such as Stripe or PayPal sandbox.
* Enable users to transfer funds between accounts securely.
* Provide a transaction history dashboard where users can track their financial activities.
* Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL as the database for storing user and transaction data.
* Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets to keep users updated on transactions.
* Integrate currency conversion API (e.g., CurrencyLayer) to support multi-currency transactions.

## Technologies Used
* Node.js – Backend runtime environment
* Express.js – Web framework for building RESTful APIs
* MongoDB / PostgreSQL – Database for storing user and transaction data
* Mongoose / Sequelize – ORM for database interactions

## Project Description: “FintechWallet”

Fintech Wallet API is a secure digital wallet service that enables users to register, log in, add funds, transfer money, and track transaction history through a well-structured API.
The task involved building a robust financial transaction system where users can add funds via mock payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal sandbox), transfer funds between accounts,
and view detailed transaction history. Real-time WebSocket notifications ensure users are instantly updated on their transactions, 
while CurrencyLayer API integration allows seamless currency conversion. Security measures, including JWT authentication, rate limiting, and data validation, 
were implemented to ensure a fraud-resistant system.

The backend was built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB/PostgreSQL, with Mongoose/Sequelize as the ORM for efficient database management. 
Postman documentation provides clear API usage guidelines, while Joi validation ensures data integrity. This project showcases secure payment handling, 
scalable API architecture, and real-time financial transaction management. 🚀

## Getting Started
## Mini-project   Fintech Wallet

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.
